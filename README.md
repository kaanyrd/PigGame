# PigGame
## I developed a mini game with HTML, CSS(responsive) and JS.
## How to Play: 
Pig is a simple dice game that can be played with two or more players. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a predetermined score, typically 50 points. Here's how to play:
-On a player's turn, they roll a single die: The player continues to roll as many times as they wish, adding up the total of each roll, until they decide to stop rolling or they roll a 1.
-If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn and their turn is over: The player's turn is now over and they score zero points for that round.
-If the player stops rolling voluntarily, they can choose to either "bank" their points or continue to roll: If the player chooses to bank their points, they add the total of all their rolls to their overall score. If the player chooses to continue rolling, they risk rolling a 1 and losing all their points accumulated during that turn.
-The game continues with each player taking turns rolling the dice until one player reaches the predetermined score.
-The first player to reach the predetermined score wins the game.
